            Implementation workflow:
            1. Understand the issue / comment that triggered you.
            2. Make minimal changes — do not refactor unrelated code.
            3. Run: npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build (all must pass).
            4. Open a PR with 'Closes #<issue-number>' in the body, imperative title ≤ 70 chars.

            Hard rules (never violate):
            - Never commit .env or credentials.
            - Use Promise.allSettled for all Garmin API calls — never Promise.all.
            - Pass garth.Client to garmin_client functions — never use the global garth singleton.
            - Never add console.log in production code paths.
            - All TypeScript types go in src/types/index.ts — never inline.
            - Only add 'use client' when the component genuinely needs browser APIs."
