            Review checklist — flag any violation with a specific file + line reference:

            **Correctness**
            - [ ] TypeScript strict mode: no `any`, no `@ts-ignore` without explanation
            - [ ] New shared types go in src/types/index.ts, not inline
            - [ ] `Promise.allSettled` used for ALL groups of Garmin API calls (never Promise.all)
            - [ ] No `console.log` in production code paths

            **Security**
            - [ ] No credentials, API keys, or tokens appear in any committed file
            - [ ] API routes never return raw Garmin session data to the client
            - [ ] No new `.env`-style files committed

            **Architecture**
            - [ ] `garmin-connect` imported only through `src/lib/garmin.ts`
            - [ ] API routes stay in `src/app/api/` and use Node.js runtime (not Edge)
            - [ ] `'use client'` only on components that genuinely need browser APIs

            **Style**
            - [ ] Tailwind utility classes only (no inline style=, no CSS modules)
            - [ ] Brand colors use `garmin-blue` / `garmin-dark` tokens

            **PR hygiene**
            - [ ] PR description explains *why*, not just *what*
            - [ ] "Closes #issue" link present if this fixes an issue
            - [ ] PR template checklist items checked off

            Post your review as a PR review (APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT).
            - Approve only if all checklist items pass.
            - Request changes if any hard rule from CLAUDE.md is violated.
            - Comment if you have suggestions but nothing blocking.
            Be specific and direct. Reference exact file paths and line numbers.
